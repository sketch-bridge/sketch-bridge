## Features

- **Code Editor**: Write and edit code in a web-based code editor.
- **Build**: Compile the code to check for errors.
- **Flash**: Flash the compiled code to an Arduino board.
- **Serial Monitor**: Monitor the serial output of the Arduino board.
- **User Authentication**: Create an account and log in to save projects with Google account.
- **Project Management**: Save and load projects.
